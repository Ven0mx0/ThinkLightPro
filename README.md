🌱 About the Project  
Learning to code is hard — especially when you don’t know how to start.  

I’m building **ThinkLightPro** to guide beginners like me through the logic and planning stage of programming.  

I often struggled with **critical thinking, visualising code, and knowing what steps to take** when solving coding problems. I’d get stuck before writing a single line — unsure how to analyse a scenario or plan a program logically — and ended up relying too much on AI.  

**ThinkLightPro** is my way to fix that problem for myself, and help others who feel the same.  
It’s an **interactive, step-by-step tool** that helps you plan, think, and understand how to approach programming tasks before touching code.

🧩 Key Features  

- 🧠 **Scenario Input**  
  Enter your own project idea *or* choose a pre-given coding scenario to analyse.  
  The tool helps highlight inputs, outputs, and constraints.

- 🧾 **Step Builder Canvas**  
  Add steps in plain English — like “Ask for user’s name” or “Check if input is valid.”  
  Each step turns into a **color-coded block**:
  - 🟦 Input  
  - 🟨 Process  
  - 🟥 Decision  
  - 🟩 Output  
  - ⚫ End  

- 💬 **Guided Explanations & Prompts**  
  Each step can show a short explanation of programming concepts and questions that guide your reasoning.

- 💡 **AI Hints (Optional)**  
  Receive gentle suggestions without losing control of your own thinking.

- 🔍 **Reflection / Troubleshooting Mode**  
  Check for missing steps, logical errors, or edge cases before writing any code.

- 🧱 **Optional Code Skeleton**  
  Translate your plan into simple starter code in Java, Python, or JavaScript — to see how logic becomes syntax.

🎯 Who It’s For  
ThinkLightPro is for beginners who feel **stuck in their head** when coding — people who have ideas but can’t clearly visualise the steps, structure, or error handling.  

It’s also useful for those who want to **analyze existing coding problems**, step by step, and strengthen their logic skills before diving into syntax.

 💬 Why ThinkLightPro?  
**ThinkLightPro** isn’t just another flowchart app or coding tool.  
It’s a **logic-building trainer** — a space to think, plan, and reflect.  

By using it, beginners can learn how to:  
- Break down problems into clear steps  
- Understand the *why* behind each decision  
- Build confidence and independence before turning to AI or syntax
