# ThinkLightPro
Learning to code is hard — I am making ThinkLightPro to guide beginners like me through logic and planning


ThinkLightPro – Step-by-Step Programming Brain Trainer

I will try to create **ThinkLightPro** because I struggle with **critical thinking, visualising code, and knowing what steps to take when programming. Often, I found myself stuck at the very beginning, unsure how to analyse a scenario or plan a program logically, and ended up relying heavily on AI just to get something working.

ThinkLight will be designed to **solve this problem for me — and for other beginners. It’s an interactive, step-by-step tool that helps you train your brain to approach programming tasks critically, understand what inputs and outputs are needed, anticipate decisions, and plan logic before writing any code.

I hope this tool will help others who are learning too. **Ideas, feedback, and contributions are very welcome**, as I’m still learning myself!

### **Key Features**

* **Scenario Input:** Enter a programming task or select a sample scenario. The tool highlights inputs, outputs, and constraints.
* **Step Builder Canvas:** Add steps in plain English, which become color-coded blocks representing Input, Process, Decision, Output, and End. Blocks can be nested and collapsed to visualise program flow.
* **Guided Explanations & Prompts:** Each step explains programming concepts and asks questions that guide your reasoning.
* **AI Hints (Optional):** Receive suggestions without losing control of your thinking process.
* **Reflection / Troubleshooting:** Check for missing steps, logical errors, and potential crashes before coding.
* **Optional Code Skeleton:** Translate your plan into skeleton code in Java, Python, or JavaScript to see how logic becomes code.

### **Why ThinkLight?**

ThinkLight is not just a visualizer — it’s a **logic-building tutor**. It helps beginners **think through problems, plan steps, and analyse scenarios**, so that coding becomes a natural process, not a leap into unknown syntax.
